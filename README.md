Global Grid has been conceived with the aim of delivering renewable energy economically and reliably to residential and commercial users, through the use of a 2-tiered crypto currency platform. The various revenue centres within the energy economy will interact with either the variable currency BitSun, or the stable currency the Joule. The interplay between the various revenue centres of the energy grid, and the fiat and crypto struggle for dominance in exchanges of services within the revenue centres as well as the overall stability of the grid as it moves from a centralized to decentralized generation and distribution model, provides opportunities for disruptive technologies and business models. 
With 60% of the world’s population living in Asia, and large parts still experiencing double-digit energy demand growth and more countries liberalising their electricity markets we have concentrated our development to this region.
Built on the Ethereum blockchain with the ability to implement smart contracts on a distributed ledger and generate immutable production data,the Bitsun token, the currency on Global Grid will provide the funding for all activities occuring in the Global Grid economy, bring liquidity, stability and store value for renewable energy assets and all Global Grid activities.
Global Grid, by  using renewable energy production to generate new crypto currency, and hardware oracles to ensure immutability of the production data, will provide an additional income stream for renewable energy producers, increase their IRR and hasten the transation from non-renewable to renewable energy. The “Solar Miners” will help validate transactions, prevent double spending and other problems common in fiat transactions, all without the need to opearte powerful CPU’s or graphc cards and the associated massive energy consumption.The Global Grid platform is also designed to manage the delivery of zero marginal cost energy, shift production and consumption patterns to prevent negative pricing, while lifting the lagging aggregate energy efficiency ratio from the current ceiling of 13%, this will in part be accomplished by Global Grid fulfilling the role as an energy aggregator for network services and solutions.
Achieving greater energy efficiency gains under the current fossil fuel-based infrastructure are limited, since the technologies designed for this system, such as the internal-combustion engine and the centralized electricity grid, have few productivity gains left to exploit. However, studies indicate that, through a transition to an IoT infrastructure, “it is conceivable to increase aggregate energy efficiency to 40 percent or more in the next 40 years, amounting to a dramatic increase in productivity beyond what the economy experienced in the in the previous century.”
The global energy economy’s current business models ability to achieve greater efficiencies and its vulnerability to the zero marginal cost phenomime may cause it to follow the music industry which was brought to its knees from the shared economy, the film industry which suffered substantial profitability reductions , newspapers and magazines which have gone out of business, and the book-publishing market, which has virtually disappeared.
Creating the market mechanisms to manage zero marginal cost energy and delivering substantial aggregate energy efficiencies has been guiding principal for developing the Global Grid renewable energy economy.
